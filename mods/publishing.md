# Publishing Geode Mods

Once your awesome mod that adds sex to Geometry Dash is finished, it's time to publish it for all the world to see! Geode comes with an in-game "Download" section where users can download mods from, which gets its content from [the Geode Mods repo](https://github.com/geode-sdk/mods) (also known as the **mods index**)

## Getting Your Mod on the Repo

> :warning: If you want to submit a mod to the official mod index, **please** provide source code! Create a GitHub repository for it or something.

*This process might change in the future, whenever we switch to a server.*

Submitting a mod to the official mod index is quite simple.
1. Build and release your mod somewhere. We highly recommend GitHub releases.
1. Create an issue on the [indexer](https://github.com/geode-sdk/indexer) repository, using the "Add/Update an entry" template.
1. Provide a **direct download link** to the .geode file
1. Create the issue.

Now, you will just have to wait until one of the staff accepts the mod.

**To release an update**, just follow the same process as for publishing new mods. If you are using GitHub release, **please** do not update the same release over and over, create new ones instead.

> :warning: Make sure to increase your mod version when updating it!!

## Guidelines

Getting a mod on the index requires a few things:

1. You haven't put a virus in your mod.

2. You're willing to put the mod up [for free](#what-about-paid-mods).

3. Your mod follows all other [required guidelines](/source/guidelines.md), and your mod passes the [Index review guidelines](/source/indexrules).

That's it. It's mostly formal stuff to make sure your mod is compatible with other mods and not dangerous. If your mod doesn't crash every five seconds, it's probably good to go.

If a mod on the index is later found to be breaking guidelines, for example it starts crashing or becomes incompatible with other mods (that it should be compatible with), we will let you know that you should update it. If the problems become severe and you don't do anything to fix the problem, we may remove your mod from the index.

## What about paid mods?

If your mod is paid, publish it yourself! Unfortunately, the Geode team doesn't want to handle processing user authentification and payments. You will have to set up your own system if you want to make your mod paid.

However, we still believe in paying creators for their work; if you want your mod on the index, but would still like to make some money out of it, you can [include a `support.md` file](/mods/publishing.md) in your mod that will show a big donate button in the mod's info page in-game. In there, you can include links to your PayPal, Patreon, OnlyFans, and whatnot :)
