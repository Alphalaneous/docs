# Installing Geode

## Using the installer

Geode can be installed using the official [installer](https://github.com/geode-sdk/installer/releases/latest). Just download the installer & run it to install the Geode loader to GD. If you're interested in developing mods for Geode, run the installer again as Administrator and install the Geode dev tools. This will install the Geode SDK on your computer & set up the required environment variables :)
