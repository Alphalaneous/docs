# Contributing

If you'd like to help with the development of Geode, we have a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/9e43WMKzhp). You're also free to just open a pull request on any Geode repository you'd like to contribute to. We'll review your request and merge it if it looks all good, and provide feedback if it has issues.
