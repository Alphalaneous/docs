# What is Geode?

## In short, it is to GD what Forge / Fabric are to Minecraft.

Geode is a **modding SDK** and **mod loader**. It contains a suite of tools that make developing mods fast and easy, and also has the actual loader for using those mods.

### For users,

Geode makes installing and updating mods as simple as the click of a button. No need to drag any odd `.DLL` files and resources; just select in-game to install a mod, and that's it. Geode also acts as a gateway for mods on different platforms; Geode will be available on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and likely Android aswell.

### For modders,

Geode lets you write simple yet refactorable and extensible code, and lets you write mods for multiple platforms from one codebase. It abstracts away unnecessary details while staying low-level, granting you a much easier programming experience without sacrificing customizability or performance. Geode also comes with multiple systems in place to make sure your mod stays compatible with others; as long as you follow Geode modding guidelines, your mod won't magically break when another is installed. Geode also gives you a standardized platform to easily distribute and update your mods.
