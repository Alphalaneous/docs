**Geode** is a [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/) mod loader and modding SDK with a modern approach towards mod development. Unlike previous mod loaders, which merely inject the DLLs and let them handle the rest, Geode aims to be a more comprehensive project, which manages loaded mods & hooks itself. Geode utilizes a trap hooking technique for hooks to ensure performance, compatability, portability and ease of use. For modders, Geode means easy development and portability; for end users, Geode means an uniform and easy experience using mods.

## Getting Started

See [Installation](INSTALLATION.md) for instructions on how to install the Geode SDK on your computer.
