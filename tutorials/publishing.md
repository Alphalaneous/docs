# Publishing Geode Mods

Once your awesome mod that adds sex to Geometry Dash is finished, it's time to publish it for all the world to see! Geode comes with an in-game "Download" section where users can download mods from, which gets its content from [the Geode Mods repo](https://github.com/geode-sdk/mods) (also known as the **mods index**)

### Getting Your Mod on the Repo

Getting your mod on the mods repo and available to all Geode users is as simple as sending the mod's **source code** to some Geode lead developer, usually by just [opening a pull request on the mods repo](https://github.com/geode-sdk/mods/pulls). If your mod is closed source, send it to HJfod for Windows mods (HJfod#1795) or Alk for Mac mods (alk1m123#3076). We will verify that your mod adheres to [Geode guidelines](#guidelines) and is good to go, and will put it up on the mods index :)

When you release an update to your mod, just send the code to us again, and we will repeat the process to update the mod.

### Guidelines

Getting a mod on the index requires a few things:

1. You haven't put a virus in your mod.

2. You're willing to put the mod up [for free](#what-about-paid-mods).

3. Your mod follows all other [required guidelines](/source/guidelines.md), and your mod passes the [Index review guidelines](/info/indexrules.md).

That's it. It's mostly formal stuff to make sure your mod is compatible with other mods and not dangerous. If your mod doesn't crash every five seconds, it's probably good to go.

If a mod on the index is later found to be breaking guidelines, for example it starts crashing or becomes incompatible with other mods (that it should be compatible with), we will let you know that you should update it. If the problems become severe and you don't do anything to fix the problem, we may remove your mod from the index.

### What about paid mods?

If your mod is paid, publish it yourself! Unfortunately, the Geode team doesn't want to handle processing user authentification and payments. You will have to set up your own system if you want to make your mod paid.

However, we still believe in paying creators for their work; if you want your mod on the index, but would still like to make some money out of it, you can include a `support.md` file in your mod that will show a big donate button in the mod's info page in-game. In there, you can include links to your PayPal, Patreon, OnlyFans, and whatnot :)
