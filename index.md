# Geode SDK

**Geode** is a [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/) mod loader and modding SDK with a modern approach towards mod development. Unlike previous mod loaders, which merely inject the DLLs and let devs handle the rest, Geode aims to be a more comprehensive project, which manages loaded mods & hooks itself. Geode has been built to ensure performance, compatibility, portability and ease of use. For devs, Geode means easy development and portability; for end users, Geode means an uniform and easy experience using mods.

## Why Geode?

The main goal of Geode is to **end mod incompatability**. Traditional modding leads very easily to compatability problems, many of which Geode attempts to address with better solutions.

On top of this, and perhaps more interestingly, **Geode provides much better ergonomics for modding**. Instead of having to deal with calling conventions, trampolines, manually setting hooks (likely in another source file), you can have all the code relevant to hooks in a [nice, clean, readable syntax](/tutorials/modify.md) contained within a single source file.

See [What is Geode](/whatisgeode.md) for more detailed information about why you should use Geode.
