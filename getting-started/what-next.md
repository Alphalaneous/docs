You should now be set on your journey to develope GD mods! If you are completely new to GD modding, a good place to start is [the Handbook](/handbook/chap0.md), which covers all of the basics of creating a Hello World.

## Geode Features

Here are a list of Geode-specific concepts you might like to familiarize yourself with:

 * [Hooking with `$modify`](/tutorials/modify.md) and [adding fields](/tutorials/fields.md)
 * [Using sprites and other resources](/mods/resources.md)
 * [Settings](/mods/settings.md) and [saving data](/mods/savedata.md)
 * [String IDs](/tutorials/nodetree.md) and [Layouts](/tutorials/layouts.md)
 * [Events](/tutorials/events.md)
 * [Using dependencies](/mods/dependencies.md)
 * [Publishing mods](/mods/publishing.md)

The [Tutorials](/tutorials) category in general is a great source for information about working with Geode mods.
