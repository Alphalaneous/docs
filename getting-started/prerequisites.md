# Prerequisites
Before you get started with developing with the Geode SDK, there are a few prerequisites that you should know about!
* Prior C++ knowledge is **HIGHLY** recommended. We do not intend in helping you at C++ from the very basics.
* Installing [Geode](https://geode-sdk.org/install/) itself! You want to test your own mods, don't you?

It is recommended that you follow the tutorials on this chapter in order.
