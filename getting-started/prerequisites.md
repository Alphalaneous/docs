# Prerequisites

Before getting started developing with the Geode SDK, there are a few prerequisites you should be aware of:

 * Prior C++ knowledge is **HIGHLY** recommended. Learning C++ alongside modding is *very* hard.
 * Installing [Geode](https://geode-sdk.org/install/) itself! You want to test your own mods, don't you?

It is recommended that you follow the tutorials on this chapter in order.
