# Basic and not-so Basic C++

This is a collection of tutorials for C++, ranging from basic language features to compiler-specific UB. This is intended as **supplemental** material for GD modders who are new to modding and C++ - **it should not be regarded as a full tutorial**. To learn C++, you should seek more information from sites such as [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp) and [learncpp](https://www.learncpp.com/).
