# What next?

idk! Its difficult to guide you on what to do next, as you can do pretty much anything :-)

## Geode Features

Modding in Geode is for the most part the same as traditional modding, however there are a few things where it differs. Here are a list of Geode-specific concepts you might like to familiarize yourself with:

 * [Hooking with `$modify`](/tutorials/modify.md) and [adding fields](/tutorials/fields.md)
 * [Using sprites and other resources](/mods/resources.md)
 * [Settings](/mods/settings.md) and [saving data](/mods/savedata.md)
 * [String IDs](/tutorials/nodetree.md) and [Layouts](/tutorials/layouts.md)
 * [Events](/tutorials/events.md)
 * [Using dependencies](/mods/dependencies.md)
 * [Publishing mods](/mods/publishing.md)

See also [our tutorial](/tutorials/migrating.md) for porting traditional mods to Geode.

The [Tutorials](/tutorials) category in general is a great source for information about working with Geode mods.
